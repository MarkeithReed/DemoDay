  <p>Throughout my time with Englewood Codes I have learned a lot of things. I have learned things such as: Leadership, Code, and Teams. 

Englewood Codes has taught me Leadership because it shows me at differnt times someone should stand up and take that leadership role. Englewood Codes has taught me Codes such 

as: HTMl, CSS, Twiiter Bootstrap, and Style. The Code has given oppurtunities to put my Web-Site online. Englewood Code has taught me how to work in teams and to contribute in 

a group. It has also taught me to work together and think together. </p>

          <h3>HTML</h3>
          <p>
            HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser.
HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like <html>), within the web page content. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like (<h1.> and </h1>.).

          <h3>Learning Code</h3>
          <p>
           In just 10 weeks we have learned to code HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and use GitHub. These codes has helped us create websites, and gave us a higher knowledge on technology.

          <h3>CSS</h3>
          <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation semantics (the look and formatting) of a document written in a markup language. Its most common application is to style web pages written in HTML and XHTML, but the language can also be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.
