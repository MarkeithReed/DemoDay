  <p>Throughout my time with Englewood Codes I have learned a lot of things. I have learned things such as: Leadership, Code, and Teams. 

Englewood Codes has taught me Leadership because it shows me at differnt times someone should stand up and take that leadership role. Englewood Codes has taught me Codes such 

as: HTMl, CSS, Twiiter Bootstrap, and Style. The Code has given oppurtunities to put my Web-Site online. Englewood Code has taught me how to work in teams and to contribute in 

a group. It has also taught me to work together and think together. </p>
