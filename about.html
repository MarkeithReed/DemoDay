   <p>My name is Markeith Reed JR. I am currently a Junior at South Shore International College Prep. I was born in the Englewood community of Chicago, IL. I was introduced to baseball in 5th grade. I started playing with a team called The Angels, and continued playing for many teams for seven consecutive years; until I went to High School. When I entered SSICP, I began playing Football. I played for one year, then joined Track & Field because of it competitveness.</p>
   <p>After high School I plan to attend Mississippi Valley State University. I will study Biology then Neurology.I would like to be a Neurologist because i like to work and study the nerves in the body and also help people. If my plans as a Neurosergeon doesn't work out I plan to be a Vetenarian. I love helping & working with animals. I also want to get married, have a family, and work until the age of 65. </p>
